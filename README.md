## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
Experiences:
Although i did not have any hand on experiecne with Svelte before this project, it was still and intersting and eye opening experience which will be treated as a valueable learning oppurnity. I was able to explore its core featuers such as reactive stores and component based architecture which helped me appreciate the simplicty of the framework.

This experience has sparked my interest in learning more about Svelte, and i am eager to deepen my skills thorugh real world applications. I believe that given the oppurnity, i can quickly grow into the framwork and contribute effectively by leveraging Svelte's powerful capabilities.
